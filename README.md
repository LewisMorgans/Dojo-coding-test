#### Localhost access to data-screen: http://localhost:4200/countries

- Unit testing completed. 
- Lazy loading implemented. 
- Method implemented to map API data into array of Country objects.
- Country data displayed and manipulated in DOM via native Angular framework operators and pipes.

CSS mostly completed to my own competencies and time constraints in adherence to the provided figma design.

Further considerations for improvements:

- Implement HTTP Interceptors to process API data caching and response type comparison.
- Compartmentalising countries component elements into child components to maintain SOLID design principles.
