Unit testing completed. Lazy loading implemented. Datastream subscribed to asynchronusly via Async pipe and selected data displayed via DOM with keyvalue indexies.

Problem approached by managing data stream subscription with the Angular async pipe. Utilising built in operators such as *ngFor over keyvalue you pairs to display data requested in the readme.md to match those that are in the data models.

CSS not approached.
